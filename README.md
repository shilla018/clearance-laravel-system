- Friendly error pages for common HTTP errors

## Tech Stack

/about         About page
/login         Login page
/forgot-password
/dashboard     Protected dashboard
/dashboard/profile
/dashboard/notifications
```

## Requirements

- PHP 8.2 or newer
- Composer
- MySQL or another database supported by Laravel

## Installation

```bash
composer install
```

Create your local environment file:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Then update the database values in `.env`:

```env
APP_NAME="NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF TRANSPORT"
APP_ENV=local
APP_KEY=
APP_DEBUG=true
APP_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8000

DB_CONNECTION=mysql
DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
DB_PORT=3306
DB_DATABASE=your_database_name
DB_USERNAME=your_database_user
DB_PASSWORD=your_database_password
```

Then run:

```bash
php artisan key:generate
php artisan migrate
php artisan serve
```

Open:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:8000
```

## Start Your Own Git Repository

If you downloaded this starter kit and want to use it as your own project, remove the existing Git history first, then initialize a fresh repository:

```bash
rm -rf .git
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial project setup"
```

On Windows PowerShell:

```powershell
Remove-Item -Recurse -Force .git
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial project setup"
```

After that, create your own GitHub repository and connect it:

```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

## Testing

```bash
php artisan test
```

## Dashboard Notes

The dashboard contains a mix of real and placeholder data:

- `Total Users` comes from the users table.
- `Active Sessions`, `New Messages`, `Pending Tasks`, summary tiles, and chart values are placeholder/demo values.
- These placeholders are meant to be replaced with real business data as you build your application.

## Authentication Notes

Authentication is custom-built with local controllers:

- `LoginController`
- `PasswordResetController`

This project is not using Laravel Breeze or Jetstream.

## Known Notes

- Use `.env.example` as the template for local setup. Never commit real production secrets in `.env`.
- The visible pages are powered by Blade, Bootstrap, and public CSS/JS files.
- The dashboard chart and several dashboard counters are demo placeholders.
- If old styles remain in the browser, run `php artisan view:clear` and hard refresh with `Ctrl + F5`.

## Suggested Next Steps

- Replace dashboard placeholder data with real queries.
- Add role and permission logic if your application needs admins, staff, or users.
- Add CRUD modules for your project domain.
- Add tests for authentication, profile updates, and dashboard access.
- Add tests for any new CRUD modules you build.
